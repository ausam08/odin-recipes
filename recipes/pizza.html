        <h3>What is Pizza?</h3>

    </p>
    <p>
        Pizza is a beloved dish that combines a variety of flavors and textures in a single, satisfying experience. At its core, pizza features a round,
         flat base made from dough that is typically baked until it's golden and crisp. This crust serves as a canvas for an array of toppings.

        The classic pizza starts with a layer of tomato sauce, seasoned with herbs and spices like oregano and basil. On top of the sauce, youâ€™ll find a generous layer of melted cheese, usually mozzarella, which becomes gooey and slightly browned during baking. From there, the pizza can be customized with a wide range of toppings,
        such as pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, and more.
