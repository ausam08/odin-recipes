        <h3>What is a fried egg?</h3>

    </p>
    <p>
        Fried eggs are a simple yet delicious breakfast staple, known for their rich, comforting flavor and versatility.
        They start with a whole egg cracked into a hot, lightly oiled or buttered skillet. 
        As the egg cooks, the white turns opaque and sets, while the yolk remains soft and runny or slightly firm, 
        depending on how long it's cooked. creating a savory, juicy center with a satisfying texture.
