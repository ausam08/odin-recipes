        <h3>What is a Burger?</h3>

    </p>
    <p>
        A burger is a classic American dish that features a hearty patty, typically made from ground beef,
        nestled between two soft, often toasted, buns. The patty is usually seasoned and grilled or fried to perfection, creating a savory, juicy center with a satisfying texture.
    </p>
    <p>
        The burger's basic structure includes the bottom bun, a layer of condiments like ketchup, mustard, 
        or mayonnaise, followed by the cooked patty. On top of the patty, you might find a slice of melted cheese, 
        such as cheddar or American, which adds a creamy richness. Toppings often include fresh ingredients like lettuce, 
        tomato slices, pickles, and onions, which add crunch and freshness.
